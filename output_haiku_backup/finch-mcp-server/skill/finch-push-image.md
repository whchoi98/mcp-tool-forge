description: Push a container image to a repository using finch, replacing the tag with the image hash.

    If the image URL is an ECR repository, it verifies that ECR login cred helper is configured.
    This tool  gets the image hash, creates a new tag using the hash, and pushes the image with
    the hash tag to the repository. If the image URL is an ECR repository, it verifies that
    ECR login is properly configured before proceeding with the push.

    The tool expects the image to be already built and available locally. It uses
    'finch image inspect' to get the hash, 'finch image tag' to create a new tag,
    and 'finch image push' to perform the actual push operation.

    When the server is in read-only mode (which is the default unless --enable-aws-resource-write
    is specified), this tool will return an error when pushing to ECR repositories.

    Returns:
        Result: An object containing:
            - status (str): "success" if the operation succeeded, "error" otherwise
            - message (str): A descriptive message about the result of the operation

    Example response:
        Result(status="success", message="Successfully pushed image 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-repo:abcdef123456 to ECR.")
