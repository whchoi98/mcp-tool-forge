description: Fetch and convert an AWS documentation page to markdown format.

    ## Usage

    This tool retrieves the content of an AWS documentation page and converts it to markdown format.
    For long documents, you can make multiple calls with different start_index values to retrieve
    the entire content in chunks.

    ## URL Requirements

    - Must be from the docs.aws.amazon.com domain
    - Must end with .html

    ## Example URLs

    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-invocation.html

    ## Output Format

    The output is formatted as markdown text with:
    - Preserved headings and structure
    - Code blocks for examples
    - Lists and tables converted to markdown format

    ## Handling Long Documents

    If the response indicates the document was truncated, you have several options:

    1. **Continue Reading**: Make another call with start_index set to the end of the previous response
    2. **Stop Early**: For very long documents (>30,000 characters), if you've already found the specific information needed, you can stop reading

    Args:
        ctx: MCP context for logging and error handling
        url: URL of the AWS documentation page to read
        max_length: Maximum number of characters to return
        start_index: On return output starting at this character index

    Returns:
        Markdown content of the AWS documentation
